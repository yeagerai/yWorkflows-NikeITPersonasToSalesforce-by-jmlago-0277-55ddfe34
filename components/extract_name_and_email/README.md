# Component Name: ExtractNameAndEmail

## Description

The ExtractNameAndEmail component is a part of a Yeager Workflow, designed to extract names and email addresses from the given input data (personas) and forwards the extracted data to Salesforce.

## Input and Output Models

- **Input Model**: The input data type for the component is `PersonasData`, which is a Pydantic `BaseModel` that has a single field (`personas`) containing a list of dictionaries. Each of these dictionaries represents a persona with various attributes.
- **Output Model**: The output data type for the component is `NamesAndEmails`, which is also a Pydantic `BaseModel` with a single field (`names_and_emails`) containing a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (str) and an email address (str).

## Parameters

There are no configurable parameters in this component.

## Transform Function

The `transform()` method accepts an instance of `PersonasData` as its input and returns an instance of `NamesAndEmails`. It performs the following steps:

1. Initializes an empty list called `names_and_emails`.
2. Loops through each persona in `args.personas`.
3. Extracts the `name` and `email` fields from the persona.
4. Appends a tuple containing the name and email address to the `names_and_emails` list.
5. Calls the Salesforce API to send the extracted data (Note: The implementation for interacting with Salesforce API should be added by the user.)
6. Returns an instance of `NamesAndEmails` with the `names_and_emails` list as its argument.

## External Dependencies

- `typing`: The component uses `List` and `Tuple` from the `typing` module to define complex data types for input and output models.
- `fastapi`: The component uses `FastAPI` to create an API for handling transform requests.
- `pydantic`: The component uses `BaseModel` from the `pydantic` library for input and output data validation and serialization.

## API Calls

The component is designed to make a call to the Salesforce API, but the actual implementation is left for the user. The purpose of this call is to send the extracted names and email addresses to Salesforce.

## Error Handling

The component does not handle errors explicitly. Exceptions thrown by external libraries, such as `pydantic` for data validation or any exceptions in the Salesforce API interaction implementation, will propagate up the call stack and need to be handled by the user.

## Examples
